To be considered for a prize from Dolby.io in this hackathon.

**Eligibility**

1. You must follow all event rules and code of conduct.
2. At least one team member must sign up for an account -- instructions below.
3. You must make at least one successful Dolby.io API request as part of your project.

You can learn more about what the prizes are: https://try.dolby.io/brickhack7/

**Exclusions**

- using a Dolby technology such as Atmos, Vision, Cinema, Gaming, etc. (while cool) does not count


**Judging Criteria**

- Working: your application should run and be available for judges to take a look at the source code as evidence of work using a Dolby.io API
- Creative: a novel or creative idea that explores how Dolby.io APIs could be used in new ways
- Purposeful: projects that serve a purpose or solve a problem that others might have

If you do something [awesome with audio](https://github.com/DolbyIO/awesome-audio) or helpful to the broader audio community we'll also be taking notice and have a few bonus prizes to be awarded soon after the event.

# Getting Help

Please use our Discord channel if you have questions about how to use our APIs.  If you find an issue in a client code repository, please use the feedback form below before creating a GitHub issue.

**Feedback Bonus**

If you have suggestions and feedback for how to improve Dolby.io APIs or that might help somebody else on a project, let us know.  We'll be reviewing the feedback and award a community prize soon after the event as a thank you for your contribution.

# Getting Started

## Interactivity APIs

This SDK helps you add real-time audio / video communications to an app of your own creation instead of using a third-party stand-alone video conferencing tool.  This is done by using a client SDK for a web application (WebRTC) or mobile native (iOS / Android).

**Inspiration**

- demonstrate how real-time communication could be used in your own education app
- explore how real-time communication could be used in a game or entertainment
- demonstrate how real-time communication could be used to help with health
- investigate how to collaborate with others while including voice
- learn how to record a real-time interaction and then do something interesting with the recording
- build a web application to create a clever video conferencing layout for streaming (webinar, live-coding)

**Where to Begin**

- Tutorial to [Create a Basic Audio Conference Application](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/tutorials/getting-started/quick-start)
- Clone and download sample code for [browser](https://github.com/voxeet/voxeet-sdk-browser-gettingstarted), [ios](https://github.com/voxeet/voxeet-sdk-ios-gettingstarted), or [android](https://github.com/voxeet/voxeet-sdk-android-gettingstarted) and start making changes
- Use this [mixer layout](https://github.com/dolbyio-samples/blog-mixer-layout) sample to customize the appearance of a video stream

## Media Processing APIs

There are two APIs that can be useful for working with recorded audio.

1. Media Analyze API - given an audio file, will return data about it
2. Media Enhance API - given an audio file, will create an improved version of it

This media must be available from the cloud, so shorter clips work best.  You can use your own file storage (S3, GCP, etc.) or we provide a Media Input and Media Output to upload and download files as well.

**Inspiration**

- demonstrate how to use another audio library in combination with a Dolby.io Media API
- demonstrate how to manage media in the cloud with a storage provider and Dolby.io Media API
- create a visualization for audio that you analyze
- capture audio on a mobile device in an unusual environment and try to enhance it
- investigate [awesome audio](https://github.com/DolbyIO/awesome-audio) resources and contribute to it
- write a tutorial or guide on how to use a Dolby.io Media API as a plugin from an application or new programming language

**Where to Begin**

- Quick Start Tutorial for [Media Analyze API](https://dolby.io/developers/media-processing/tutorials/quick-start/analyzing-media) and [Media Enhance API](https://dolby.io/developers/media-processing/tutorials/quick-start/enhancing-media)

- You can find more sample media in the [Awesome Audio](https://github.com/DolbyIO/awesome-audio) repository (check [collections](https://github.com/DolbyIO/awesome-audio/blob/main/README.md#collections) and [data](https://github.com/DolbyIO/awesome-audio/blob/main/README.md#data) sections)

## Bonus Prizes

We will also be giving out a few additional bonus prizes along the way.

1. Contribute something awesome to the audio community to help others learn how to solve a common problem
2. Contribute something helpful for others that want to use Dolby.io as part of their own projects (open-source license)
3. Send feedback to us if you have suggestions that can help us improve your experience

We will have t-shirts as well as gift cards to give out while supplies last.  You can find the form here: https://dolbyioprograms.typeform.com/to/WAK4SDGI
